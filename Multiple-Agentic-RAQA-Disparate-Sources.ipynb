Gorgeously fathomed costumes, grand architecture and brutal battle scenes where if you blink you might miss a startling effect. There is also some slomo battle sequences which are welcomed as well. Well paced movie for entertainment value. Its not a deep dive into the ins and outs of European politics of the late 18th century, but a well rounded portrayal of the reign of Napoleon. Like a greatest hits album of his reign. The famous battle of Waterloo is also portrayed, having the most on screen battalions in formation I can think of. More so than the battles in the Gettysburg movie. But not as many cannon. Gettysburg has an awesome cannonade sequence that is the best put to film yet. Like 2 minutes straight of cannon firing.

Rarely in recent history has a film been so widely criticized for its historical inaccuracies. We didn\\'t hear that kind of backlash for The Crown or Bridgerton, so why such disappointment in historic representation in this specific case?\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv\\n\\nReview: This should have been called \"Napoleon and Josephine\" because, frankly, there\\'s too much of Josephine in it, and not nearly enough of the brilliance and personality of Bonaparte. The historical inaccuracies are manifold. I read that director Scott says that \"If you weren\\'t there then you can **** off\". Well I was not there, but the erroneous simplification of one of history\\'s greatest characters shows Scott wasn\\'t there either. The battle scenes are gaining accolades, but even they shouldn\\'t. Wrong and over simplified. If you are going to make a movie about Napoleon, his generalship should have taken centre-stage, not his domestic tussles with the Missus. A grand disappointment. An artilleryman, as Napoleon was, taking part in a cavalry charge? I don\\'t think so! Oh, how I wish Kubrick had carried through to make his version. I give this six stars, mostly for having the courage to take on such a mighty story. Too bad it fell far short of its subject matter.\\n\\nReview_Date: 24-Nov-23\\nAuthor: esyurt\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Great balance of action and drama.\\nReview: The movie consists of a beautiful balance of drama and action. For those who like action you will not be disappointed the war scenes are amazing. I feel as though those giving low ratings are just salty because of the depiction of napoleon I\\'m not a historian but I would assume they tried to capture his personality as close to reality as they could and this may have offended the frenchies. The only thing negative I can say is that the timeline is excessively shortened in order to fit the movie time limit, it\\'s a shame these historic movies aren\\'t filmed over multiple movies to retain intricate detail.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv\\n\\nReview: Although not Shakespearean, nor is there much French tongue, this movie delivers a convincing portrayal of European aristocracy of the 1790s and early 1800s. Gorgeously fathomed costumes, grand architecture and brutal battle scenes where if you blink you might miss a startling effect. There is also some slomo battle sequences which are welcomed as well. Well paced movie for entertainment value. Its not a deep dive into the ins and outs of European politics of the late 18th century, but a well rounded portrayal of the reign of Napoleon. Like a greatest hits album of his reign. The famous battle of Waterloo is also portrayed, having the most on screen battalions in formation I can think of. More so than the battles in the Gettysburg movie. But not as many cannon. Gettysburg has an awesome cannonade sequence that is the best put to film yet. Like 2 minutes straight of cannon firing. I love it. But, yes, the battles in Napoleon deliver striking effects and large processions of', name='PublicReviews'),\n",

            "Review: What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.\n",

This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it\\'s unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What\\'s even worse is that it\\'s unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he\\'s portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv\\n\\nReview: \"Napoleon\" leaves you completely indifferent and emotionally cold. In my opinion, this is the disappointment of the movie year so far. Phoenix is tragically underchallenged and grunts unmotivatedly through the \"plot\" when he\\'s not ramming Josephine like a billy goat or sleeping standing up (I fear that this excellent actor\\'s eyes had actually closed in the face of this direction). Sure, very beautiful images and sceneries, beautiful costumes, you can feel the huge amount of money there. But imho the whole movie is just like a series of expensive reenactments for a embarassingly sloppy researched documentary, only without a documentary in between. There is not a single truly credible interaction between the characters, the \"love story\" between Josephine and Napoleon is completely superficial (not to mention the incomprehensible idea of making the actress playing Josephine appear much younger than Napoleon, while in historical reality she was over 10 years older).
