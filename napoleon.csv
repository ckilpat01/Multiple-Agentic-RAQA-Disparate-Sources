2-Mar-24,Eleatic67,6," Images without Words
","The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

27-Nov-23,granka-47093,," Stuff just happens...
","Ridley Scott's Napoleon is a high-budget cinematic exercise in ""Whatever, man, that'll do.""
The film, both in terms of what it presents and how it presents, reeks of hollowness. Characters are shadows(not defined enough to even be considered parodies or mockeries of their real-life counterparts as some people like to see them), story is a shadow of a proper story( at times feeling as if written by A. I), atmosphere, with the exception of some of the battle scenes and the Russian segment, sterile and practically non existent(disasterous for Scott who is known to be one of the greatest world builders in history of the artform). Stuff just happens in the film. No significance or weight to anything or anybody... Sure, it's not all bad. The classic Ridley Scott elements are here - battles are engaging, the costumes and set designs very well-done. Something he can't help but always be good at.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

","I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yes, the film is somewhat disjointed. It would have been much better off being a mini-series. However, apart from that, I can't really fault the movie, and it's an absolute mystery to me why everyone seems to hate it so much. Granted, I can't really judge its historical accuracy, I'm merely speaking about its merits as a drama. Well, it's beautifully shot and it never gets dull. And it's still way above average.

27-Nov-23,nicula-eduard-andrei,6," A shallow representation
","When i first heard about Ridley Scott making a Napoleon movie with Joaquin Phoenix as lead actor, i was very excited. Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing. The feeling that i got was that we saw a fast forward version of his life but without any soul or essence. Even the battle scenes seemed dull and without soul. I think Ridley set the bar too high through his previous movies for this part. Regarding Joaquin's performance, there is not much to say. I think his interpretation was similar to a performance you would see in a stage theater. I don't know why but at some points in the movie, it felt like a low budget movie with very poor writing and very poor dialogue. I will wait for the extended version to see if my opinion changes for the best.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

The film has over 20 years of history to cover but includes so many huge time skips that you can't help feeling that you're missing out on a huge amount. This should have been a series and given the writers and the actors the time they deserved to tell the story properly but instead we get something that seems rushed and has huge gaps in time where things are shunted forward just se we can reach the end of the story before time runs out.

BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities.

","As usual, Phoenix is very good, but there just seems to be something missing from his character. More importantly, a story of such epic proportions is much better suited as a miniseries (along the lines of HBO's John Adams). In fairness, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Apple TV version was almost 4 hours long, so the theatrical version had to be cut by almost 2 hours. The result leaves the viewer trying to decipher the timeline and fill in missing details as the story leapfrogs huge gaps of time. Napoleon's character is complex and he's shown as brave, scared, sniveling, proud, steadfast and prideful. Without the full story, that odd mixture of traits is a little confusing, despite Phoenix's strengths.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv
10-Dec-23,trevjohns,6," Should have been called Napoleon and Josephine
","This should have been called ""Napoleon and Josephine"" because, frankly, there's too much of Josephine in it, and not nearly enough of the brilliance and personality of Bonaparte. The historical inaccuracies are manifold. I read that director Scott says that ""If you weren't there then you can **** off"". Well I was not there, but the erroneous simplification of one of history's greatest characters shows Scott wasn't there either. The battle scenes are gaining accolades, but even they shouldn't. Wrong and over simplified. If you are going to make a movie about Napoleon, his generalship should have taken centre-stage, not his domestic tussles with the Missus. A grand disappointment. An artilleryman, as Napoleon was, taking part in a cavalry charge? I don't think so! Oh, how I wish Kubrick had carried through to make his version.

","With every biopic, the question is always: how do you condense a person's life in a 2 or 3 hour motion picture? However, simultaneously, you have to have enough material to make a film out off. With a figure like Napoleon, the balance clearly shifts to having so much material to work with that one cinematic release may not be enough to satisfactorily portray the man's life. While this concern was already there before release, we have seen great movies about bigger-than-life men and women succeed like Gandhi (1982). And with a director like Ridley Scott, you want to give the project the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, The movie falls into the trap that has haunted other biopics which is a lack of focus. In other words, instead of elucidating a character's life, we get a collection of highlights about that character's history which doesn't build up to an overall great experience.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose.

Sure, very beautiful images and sceneries, beautiful costumes, you can feel the huge amount of money there. But imho the whole movie is just like a series of expensive reenactments for a embarassingly sloppy researched documentary, only without a documentary in between. There is not a single truly credible interaction between the characters, the ""love story"" between Josephine and Napoleon is completely superficial (not to mention the incomprehensible idea of making the actress playing Josephine appear much younger than Napoleon, while in historical reality she was over 10 years older). Basically, this film is nothing more than a rushed sequence of the ""best of"" stations from Napoleon's life that can be found in any history book (whereby really important stations such as the discovery of the ""Rosetta Stone"" are simply swept under the table), but unfortunately it is soulless and lovelessly realised. Any hint of motivation or drama is nipped in the bud. The admittedly impressive battle scenes (which are also reeled off without any deeper emotion) can't really save the day.

Well paced movie for entertainment value. Its not a deep dive into the ins and outs of European politics of the late 18th century, but a well rounded portrayal of the reign of Napoleon. Like a greatest hits album of his reign. The famous battle of Waterloo is also portrayed, having the most on screen battalions in formation I can think of. More so than the battles in the Gettysburg movie. But not as many cannon. Gettysburg has an awesome cannonade sequence that is the best put to film yet. Like 2 minutes straight of cannon firing.

Starting with the narrative subtitles, explaining in broad strokes the French Revolution and identifying major players, the audience is already being told not to overly worry about subtext. And it becomes clear early on, that the intention is not to humanize Napoleon, as much as de-mythologize him, to the extent of humiliation.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv
22-Jan-24,felipearielm,8," It's not what we asked for.
","The film is not the epic you are expecting, it's not a history lesson (thank God) and it's not as bad as you think. Of course, the film has a lot of problems, it's a little bit confusing and disorganized, the main characters are not deeply developed, so many of the premisses of the plot are not so convincing. Despite the feeling that it could have been better, watching Napoleon was far from being the bad experience many told me it would be. I wonder if this unusual aproache by Scott wasn't influenced by the bad box office from The Last Duel. Anyways, solid 8/10 in my opinion. I have a feeling the extended director's cut will be quite different and better film.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

1-Feb-24,jaredmarkherbert,7," Ridley Scott's Napoleon: An Epic yet Unsatisfactorily Incomplete Biography of the Legendary Leader
","An arguably good attempt at displaying the imperialistic ambitions and militaristic prowess that is Napoleon Bonaparte. However, despite the depiction of fantastic battle scenes, the film tends to jump around a bit and is not effectively woven together as to bring Napoleon's entire narrative into one seamless, cohesive piece for the audience. There are also many relevant historical facts missing from the film, including some large and other minute details that could have easily been sprinkled in. This in spite of the movie being roughly 2 hours & 40 minutes long. As a counterpoint, Director Ridley Scott never claimed to make the movie completely historically factual; and the film is debatably more historically anchored than a lot of other films which claim to be ""based on true events"".",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

28-Nov-23,Rms88,6," Not What I Expected!
","I was somewhat disappointed in Ridley Scott's movie as it was not what I expected. The movie dragged for the first hour. It didn't focus much on historical and political details. It also lacked much fighting in the battlefield, especially not displaying Napoleon's tactical and genius strategy. His rise and fall lacked the specifics in a lightning fashion. In addition, it didn't seem historically accurate as it also didn't concentrate on his mistakes such as the Continental System and the outrage of the French people after crowning himself King. The French Revolution was about overthrowing a monarch, yet he crowns himself king. The entire movie focused on his beloved wife, Josephine. It was more of a love story.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

25-Nov-23,andrei1981-1,6," Ridley Scott is such a trickster
","Ridley Scott has tricked me. I really thought I was going to watch a movie about Napoleon. But two hours into it I realized I'm actually watching a movie about the English. Scott made short shrift of Napoleon's victories and spent 40 minutes on Waterloo. One of the greatest tactical minds in history and the man who terrorized the whole of Europe is reduced here to a grotesque caricature. Phoenix, otherwise an excellent actor, lacks charisma as Napoleon and the two protagonists (Napoleon and Josephine) have zero chemistry. Given the hype created around it, I consider the movie a flop. Scott has fallen knee deep into the trap of artistic hubris, as he arrogantly believes he's entitled to remake and reshape historical figures with impunity. If he wants full freedom, there's always fiction, an endless reservoir of stories, but when you're bringing to the screen one of the most (in)famous characters in history, more reverence is needed. Scott's iconoclastic bravado is now being punished by the public. It makes me very nervous to think that he's working on a new Gladiator. That's truly bad news.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv
29-Nov-23,UniqueParticle,7," Very enjoyable
","This is an extraordinary film. Sure it's got flaws, but to me, the only one is it is a bit boring at times otherwise so damn good! Stupendous Imax for sound and beautiful scenery. I'm not entirely sure why this got some hate - it's a great movie especially Joaquin's performance and holy cow Vanessa Shaw is stunning - she was a great addition to everything! The war bits were excellent, the set design/clothes were all impressive, some of it was goofy which was unexpected, and the acting alone deserves recognition. I think it's cute how plenty of old folks go to see this I'm 31 though I enjoyed a lot of the movie my only problem is it was a little slow at times.",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Ms Marvle fans out here really mad at this movie. Telling people not to go see it on thanksgiving as a family film even for older adults. They are creepy and wierd asf. Don't even get me started on Zegler trolls in here review bombing as well cause they are just unlikable as she is. Well let's get to the core of the film this is a masterpiece! The practical effects in this are soooo good this helps cleanse the pallet after decades of green screen super hero's! We have a refreshing new look in to Napoleon! Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar again or at least get a nod from the guild then the Oscar's are truly dead, well when you pick Jimmy Kimmel to be the front man then you know they are dead. Anyways this is masterpiece! Go watch it! Sorry I got sidetracked in this review!",/review/rw9450470/?ref_=tt_urv

Almost every shot could be captured into a neoclassical dynamic oil painting, which i think is perfect regarding napoleon preferences and the artistic aspect of the movie.
