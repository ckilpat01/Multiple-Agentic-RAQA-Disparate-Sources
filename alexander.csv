0,14-Dec-04,mharrsch-1,7," Stone stumbles over Alexander
","When ""Gladiator"" stirred a latent interest in films about the ancient world I was so hopeful we would finally be able to enjoy some exciting cinema about my favorite time period. I have not been totally disappointed. USA Television network has given us Attila, Caesar, and Helen of Troy - not without flaws but solid efforts. Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" did not resemble the Iliad I had studied but I appreciated the performances of Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Brukheimer's ""King Arthur"" could have used more experienced epic direction but was loosely based on historical accounts of Sarmatian auxiliaries and their commanders in late Roman Britain and I liked the grittier result to the fairy tale legends of my childhood. Then I heard about Oliver Stone's production of ""Alexander"" and I was sure we would have a film of the caliber of ""Ben Hur"". Unfortunately, Stone managed to take what should have been a ready-made screenplay and solid performances by Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Colin Farrel and imparted as much insight into the character and charisma of the world's most famous conqueror and military genius as the images of shadowy figures thrashing about in the blinding dust of Stone's Gaugamela.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

2,22-Jan-05,filmquestint,7," Splendorous Alexander The Great Irishman
","Oliver Stone is Oliver Stone. When you go to see one of his films you know you'll enter unknown territory. I though that was what movies were all about. A personal vision. Not documentaries or Sunday school classes. Richard Attenborough's ""Ghandi"" was that, and as a consequence Oscars, praises, oodles of cash. Ben Kingsley was superb but the title character is treated as if nobody had ever heard of ""Ghandi"" the same can be said of another Attenborough biopic: ""Chaplin"". No, Oliver Stone gives his audience a little bit more credit and, naturally, he is paying the consequences. I think the film is mind blowing. Arbitrary? Yes, beautifully so. Even the accents of the actors is one of the many strokes of genius. Within its historical context those characters spoke with different accents. They were in the ultimate melting pot. Colin Farrell bold portrayal, Irish accent and all is bound to leave its mark. Oliver Stone took every imaginable risk and I for one, applaud him with a loud Long Live the Cinema.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting, particularly from Colin Farrell in the titular role, had its moments but also felt uneven, and the casting choices were a mix of hits and misses. The music and cinematography contributed to the epic scale of the film, while Oliver Stone's directing aimed for grandiosity but occasionally felt overindulgent. The writing attempted to capture the complexity of Alexander the Great's life but struggled with pacing issues and historical accuracy.

Inexplicably, Angelina Jolie has a middle-eastern-meets-Russian kind of accent, and some have no accent at all. This hodge-podge of ridiculously out of place accents was so distracting that it was hard to stay focused on the movie.

15,6-Oct-05,pookey56,1," OK oliver
","i laughed out loud while watching this movie. i haven't enjoyed all of Oliver Stone's films so i'll give him this one. this movie left me wondering several things: 1) was Alexander's mother born before, or at the same time as her son?(and why did she go to a transylvanian voice coach?) 2) how much hydrogen peroxide was in the bleach Colin used? 3) did Val use plasticine on his face in the hopes of being unrecognizable? 4) did anyone go to the library to help with the pacing of this film? you know, those buildings with books in them? 5) was Bucephalous black, or white? did anyone care? (he was the best actor anyways) 6) if i had 9 figures to spend making a movie, would it have been this bad? (more proof that throwing money at a film doesn't do the trick) 7) did the people making this film know it was about Alexander the GREAT? did they know he was an extraordinary leader? or did someone tell them he was an angst-filled whiner? (see question #4) this film has my vote at the razzies this year for worst film. as i said i found myself laughing out loud. other leads turned the film down. if Alexander had been played by David Spade or Paulie Shore, i may have been more charitable of this mess of a film. please please, no more director's cuts or added footage...and by the way, i am a fan of most of the actors in this movie. what happened? but i stand by my statement about bucephalous. this animal didn't over-act, had a legitimate accent, and stood his ground with that poor elephant, who also gets a nod of approval from me. as far as i can tell, these are two characters who had no choice about being in this movie.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

","well, i just saw this movie and i can honestly say that even though the script was disappointing, many actors excelled in the movie. Anthony hopkins being the narrator gives you a sense of presence and understanding the movie better for younger viewers. Angelina Jolie ( which i never respected as a good actor) really blew my mind on this movie. Colin Farrel, another chick magnet like brad pitt in troy which bring money to the box office did a great job in this movie and i was simply impressed. Oliver Stone gave the chance to new actors, and others which weren't known much; just like Peter Jackson did in the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"". All the characters are developed well and they all have different personalities, which brings a good variety. I was impressed even more by Clitus and craterus.I know its history, but i think that Ptolemy wasn't the guy for the job. Val Kilmer which i thought was a 'has been' by now came back in Alexander and also did a good job. Many metaphorical moments in the movie with some flashbacks like the ones used in Hero.It could had been a great movie , and Oscar sweeper, But the script needed a much better effort than the one that was given.It had great potential, great actors, great director but a bad script. Not many people want to watch a 3 hour long movie with a bad script, thats why i conclude that it was all a 50/50 between people who liked it and people who didn't like it. Colin Farrel should be nominated at least for his effort for the Oscars, also Angelina Jolie should deserve a Oscar for her performance in the movie, though i think meryl streep from 'the manchurian candidate' will win it. I give it a 7/10 instead of 5 because the battles, the effects and the character development and performance were mind blowing. 7/10 it is.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

","You'd have thought given the amount of ancient source material which is still extant, dodgy or not, on Alexander's life that Stone could have cobbled together a story from the various accounts without resorting to simply making bits up (i.e Alexander being shot in battle with Porus), pointlessly attributing speeches from one character to another (i.e Darius's daughter giving a reply to Alexander which is actually that of Porus), having set designs which were simply ludicrous (i.e Olympias having the Ram on a tree thingy from Ur in her room)...I could go on, and on, and on...This film was simply awful on every level, the battle of Gaugamela just looked like a complete shambles, why did the Macedonians (Including non-Irish actors) put on Irish accents?

I encourage everyone to see the movie for themselves, especially if they are into history or enjoy war movies. Angelina Jolie starred once again and gave a outstanding portrayal of Alexander's mother. Like all Oliver Stone movies, Alexander was long, but it was definitely worth seeing. Many people in theater I was at clapped at the end. Colin Farrell really impressed me with his portrayal of Alexander, especially because it was such a different and unique role for him.

20,28-Nov-04,votarus4,7," Alexander  an Instant Camp Classic
","Oliver Stone has imagined a vigorous, opulent homage to the Sword and Sandal genre, and like the best of those films of a generation ago, sheer visual style, over-the-top acting, and showmanship win the day. The best of those films-Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Spartacus-also had brilliant scripts, pitting their protagonists in the center of conflicts where superhuman will and wit overcome immense odds. But as history's first and most insatiable conqueror, Alexander seems unchallenged. Mighty ancient cities fall beneath his sword like so much marshmallow, and his one true enemy-Darius, King of Persia-has no words in Stone's film at all!-he's just a face. Thus, without a central conflict to dramatize, Stone's film lowers itself to the Sword and Sandal genre's middle road, where writing takes a back seat, and characters make portentous pronouncements before going off to fulfill their destinies. Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, Alexander's mother, comes off best and worst in Stone's decadent stew. Her unnatural devotion to Alexander seems to inspire the 'You-Must-Conquer-the-Known World' flame, but she's quickly side-lined by the script and is left screaming in the wilderness, having no real effect on the ensuing action. But she looks magnificent, and her face at the moment of Philip of Macedonia's death, is alone worth the price admission. Her Transylvanian accent, however, is a distraction, as are the Irish, English and Scottish dialects of other actors. Stone's script also avoids Alexander's more elaborate military strategies-studied and duplicated for thousands of years-and makes short shrift of the ongoing power struggles he had with his generals. Colin Farrell, as Alexander, works hard and holds the screen for 3 hours with a strange mix of petulance, arrogance and good old fashioned Hollywood charm. He and Jared Leto, as Hephaistion, have a long and tender love scene (fully-clothed) on a Babylonian balcony, looking down on what has to be the most opulent scenery ever devised for a feature film. This is a clear, if telescopic homage to D.W. Griffith's 1916 Masterpiece, 'Intolerance.' All in all, Stone's Alexander is never boring, never brilliant, but always visually exciting. Probably the most gorgeous film made in years. Terrific showmanship. 7/10",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
21,20-Jan-05,robertconnor,1," What Was Mr. Stone THINKING?
","Alexander is essentially about this Russian sounding babe (played by Ms. Jolie) who marries into this big Oirish family, is driven to preferring snakes because her husband only has one eye, and begins dying her little boy's hair blonde. Then it all kicks off, Colin Farrell gets his eyebrows bleached and goes off in a flouncy tantrum to conquer the world. Meanwhile Jared Leto stands around with a twisty Cher hairdo, gazing longingly at bottle-blondie Colin, who every now and then gazes back with tears in his eyes and whispers 'Oy cahnt live if livin' is without you...' So anyway, about half way through that really handsome guy from The Book Group (the one in the wheelchair) and those porridge commercials shows up, but he has a different hairdresser... he stands around a lot, proving that sensible haircuts WERE possible in ancient times. I think he loses his razor at one point, but finds it again eventually... later Tim Piggott-Smith has to smush his hands around inside a dead animal, but they cut all his lines, so of course it all makes PERFECT sense.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
22,26-Nov-04,sturdy_ram,10," Out of the mindless masses.
","The audience is not being able to understand the difference between  ancient and modern morals, but to be honest I don't care about the  wider audience. Why should Oliver have to sugarcoat and alter his work  simply because the 'MTV generation' and mass TV watchers of the United  States don't know their history? I say he shouldn't. Their ignorance is  *their* problem, not Oliver's.  In a long shot, Oliver Stone chose to create a historically accurate  film around the life of a man, both fact and fiction, who created the  gateway for humanity's future path. Many will not appreciate this film,  because their minds are too stuffed with current calamity to realize  where their freedoms and dreams of equality originated from.   This is a brilliant film, which was portrayed correctly, from a  personable point of view, to create the character of Alexander in the  manner in which he lived; uninhibited by other influences save those  whom he loved and knew were trustworthy. This movie is about the  origins not only of the Western mind and intellect, but also plan  larger into the scheme of the man who saw and dreamt of the future- a  world which accepted each other and lived together in diversity in  harmony. This man was Alexander-- our Western father.   Like it, hate it; it doesn't really matter. The fact is, Oliver Stone  brought to his team of experts internationally respected historians to  make this film as accurate historically as possible. This should not go  without notice. Colin Farrell, a known Irish- now Hollywood loverboy,  does indeed display the heart and integrity of a natural born leader.  He has lead this cast in an epic performance, well past his personal  years and experience. He is worthy of praise in his portrayal of  Alexander.

23,16-Jan-05,esposit,7," how Alexander conquered the known world while facing different phases in his life
","Finally I saw this movie! After all that talking and controversy about it, I became more and more curious about what this talking all about. I must say that I've seen better epic movies ... even Troy was better! However I give this movie a 7 out of 10 ... It's not that bad but it could have been done much better. Firstly: I cannot understand why there was all that talking about Alexander's sexuality and the 'gay scenes' that there were supposed to be. There wasn't a big deal really! It's true that there is a lot of flirting between guys but only one kiss was seen in the movie that of Alexander (Farrell) kissing a young male dancer. The sex scene with Alexander's wife was by far more explicit when compared. I think and agree that the movie is historically accurate and that Alexander was bisexual. Sexuality was not an issue at those days so men were more free to do whatever they wanted to. Homosexuality was not a taboo!!! I admire Farrell for taking such roles ... it wasn't the first time that we saw him as a bisexual (A home a the end of the world). He is known to be some kind of a playboy so pretending to be the opposite in movies might be hard and it shows good acting. Acting means showing feelings that you don't really feel, and I think that Farrell and Leto did a great job. The acting of all of them was convincing enough and I think we had some of the greatest performances when compared with their past roles. Jolie was sexy (as always) and she really delivered. Her acting was great as did Hopkins and Kilmer. But flaws are not missing in this movie! Too different accents, Jolie is almost as old as Farrell and she played his mother, Farrell's hair, Leto's excessive make-up (too much eye liner)!!! The fight scenes were great but at first I couldn't understand who was killing who and who was winning ... it wasn't clear at all ... there was so much confusion! And the last thing ... I didn't really fell in love with the characters as we all did in Gladiator! This movie is kind of 'dry' in some aspects. I'm sure it could have been a masterpiece but it has certain things that are really missing. The movie starts with old Ptolomy (Hopkins) narrating the events of Alexander. At first we see the warrior as a young boy which became an obsession to a mother who is a snake fanatic (Jolie), who was also a crazy and cunning woman who desperately wanted her son to become a powerful king, than we meet the king (Kilmer) who was a beast and a drunk who slept with God knows how many women, there was nothing human in him. The movie than focuses on the different relationships of Alexander with his mother, the king, his best friend and lover (Leto), his soldiers when he becomes king after the murder of king philip. We see an Alexander who faces war and its bloody side, the glory of conquering the known world, marriage with a woman he doesn't really love (his true and only love was Hephaistion (Leto)) and betrayal.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is balancing on a thin line between artistic movie-making or pretentious failure. I watched it only once in its Ultimate Cut entirety and what I've witnessed is a bold epic, but besides that, much more of a character study film. The film has few shots with outdated CGI that are minimal and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The acting is quite well for what the actors are trying to portray. Everyone's saying Alexander is miscast, laughable, and weak. But that's what this movie's going for; uncovering the man behind the legend. Was that man perfect? Did he appear perfect? None of us are, but he was clever, brave beyond measure, and had the wit for war and diplomatic leadership. His speeches portrayed as motivating and convincing are also at times awkward and frail. The action is sometimes too shaky, but the battles still deliver the intensity and violent nature of death in war. The last battle, although shorter, is a marvel to behold. Full of colors, intricate designs, ferocious imagery, and artistic moments. The music by Vangelis might be his best; it lifts this whole ancient world to life and elevates certain scenes to haunting heights of craftsmanship.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

","As Anthony Hopkins in a very prophetic bit of writing tells us ""His failures tower over others successes"" I believe that's also true for Oliver Stone you may like him, or not, agree or disagree with him but you can never dismiss him. He goes for it, he takes amazing chances. Naturally, the risks are enormous. Alexander is a misfire from almost every angle. Maybe the most important aspect that in Colin Farrell's portrayal there isn't a hint of greatness. If this was really Alexander he wouldn't have made it into the history books as ""The Great"" but as ""The Queen who wanted to be King"". With this I'm not attacking the gay portrayal. That was a fact, present in every serious biography of the man. I remember the Robert Rossen version of the story, with a moody Richard Burton as Alexander and a great Danielle Darrieux as his mother. The problem there was quite different. We had hints of what made Alexander great but the film was a plodding, solemn, unexciting little epic. Maybe this is one of those subjects that mere mortals shouldn't attempt.

","Oliver Stone consulted Robin Lane Foxe, Oxford historian and the premier Alexander expert, before making this film. It shows. The film certainly ranks as one of the closest-to-the-real-story Hollywood historical mega-films. To viewers with any background in Aristotelian drama and the Greek epic, it will immediately become clear that Stone has tried hard to emulate the epic form while integrating the culture of the Greek tragedy into his film. There is plenty of fear and pity here and there are plenty of tragic elements. The aging Ptolemy as narrator even takes on some of the functions of the chorus/choir. Tragic destiny in a larger-than-life man plagued by doubts over his own decisions, his consuming passions, is the universal here; the gripping story of Alexander the historical incidental, as it were. Not surprisingly, characterization and character interaction must loom large. Which explains the numerous and lengthy monologues and dialogues. Bravo, Mr Stone. Those who can appreciate will. But I fear that hoi polloi will not appreciate. They will simply fail to understand. Postscript: If there were any episodes in Alexander's life I missed and would have liked included (at the risk of making this film even longer) it would have been the Gordian Knot and the Oasis of Siwa.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

Every time the momentum picks up a little and we finally get into it a bit, we are suddenly thrown back into yet another agonizing scene between Alexander and his mother, or his father, that stops the film dead in its tracks because of the ridiculous dialogue and over-the-top acting.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
36,25-Nov-04,siaghnon,," I Loved This Film
","Saw Alexander last night and loved it. Would I recommend it? Yes-BUT-be forewarned, this is not your classic historical epic so leave behind all ideas of what an historic epic film should be and bring along an open the mind for a wonderful ride. After all, one doesn't expect Ben-Hur or The Robe or The Ten Commandments from Oliver Stone. He uses jumpy camera shots and grainy filters as well as wonderful color filters that give the battle scenes a viscerally disturbing edge, taking the viewer out of their complacent acceptance of 21st century, violent battle scenes and making them squirm. I felt the desiccating heat at Gaugamel as well as the cloying humidity of the Indian forests. The grandeur of the CGI presentation of Babylon was awe inspiring as was the set for the Library at Alexandria.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

39,11-Oct-05,azathoth-9,1," Terrible on every level.
","OK, first off Plutarch admits that in his account of the life of Alexander he was writing to teach a lesson (about 'civilised' moderation) rather than giving a 'true' historical account and therefore intentionally cherry picks scenes from different contradictory sources (a la Rumsfeld) to suit his point. Hollywood or Neocons manipulating history is nothing new, the ancient Greeks did it themselves. Stone uses Plutarch's theme throughout his film, don't be fooled by his placing the tale in the mouth of Ptolemy, Ptolemy was used as his main source by Arrian who wrote an altogether more honest and accurate account of Alexander's life and comes to quite different conclusions than Plutarch which while still dubious in their own right are demonstrably more trustworthy than a self-admitted propagandist.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
40,17-Mar-15,Leofwine_draca,6," Unfairly maligned, likable historical epic
","Although I'd never seen it before, I knew that Alexander was a troubled film. The sheer number of different edits and versions available on DVD is testament to that – none of them successfully capture the 'spark' that would make the film a crowd-pleaser in the same way that TROY enthralled the masses. Despite the problems – and there are a fair few of them, not least the long-winded nature of the narrative (Hopkins' character is laboured and dull) and the slow moving and extraneous scenes – this is still a film I enjoyed. It's a pretty good retelling of the ancient story, employing a large cast, most of whom get the chance to shine on more than one occasion, and the spectacle is suitably impressive.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
41,21-Jul-05,perceptor,1," An Insult to the Man
","Some people speak of how this movie portrays Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion, and how many people dislike the focus on a homosexual relationship in the movie. Commonly, these comments include an assessment that the values in Alexander's day were far different from the values of our day. This is true. The homosexual relationship that existed between Alexander and Hephaestion, however, would not have been the same as a homosexual relationship today. This is one of the movie's great failings. Alexander and Hephaestion are portrayed in a manner more befitting characters on Will and Grace than as the warriors that they were. Apparently, for Oliver Stone, if someone has sex with a man that person will act like a girl.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
42,6-Jan-05,nbakker,7," Not bad at all
","Alexander the movie, in my eyes is not bad at all. Sure, it's a long ride, but it's a long story to tell. The battlefield scenes are bone crunching and action packed and not to be forgotten easily.This is an understatement. Visually I think the film is a treat, great camera-work and very much eye for detail of surroundings and costumes. The overall acting is OK, but could have been a bit better. Hopkins and Farrell good as usual, Kilmer and Jolie disappointing in my eyes. Historically the film seems correct to me, although I must admit I'm not an expert on this topic. I think Stone did a great job on showing the exceptional male friendship between Alexander and his long time friend Hephaistion. At last the lenght of the movie was a bit to long, 175 minutes should have been 150 max if you ask me. To summarize: worth watching, and definitely not as bad as the critics say. Rating should be more than the current 5.5!",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
43,4-Aug-05,rkeinc,1," All the Hype in the World Couldn't Improve this Movie!
","I waited for the DVD and the amount of marketing to convince people it was good was overwhelming. I certainly had my expectations that Oliver Stone would finally produce a good movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. Oliver Stone continues to produce movies that are horrible. From the weird Irish accents, emphasis on Alexander's gay relationships to the failed attempt by Alexander (Farrell) to inspire his legions as William Wallace (Mel Gibson) did in Braveheart, this movie was a joke. I'm pretty tolerant of bad acting and directors trying to make big budget historical productions demonstrating some knowledge of the subject matter but this was literally 165 minutes of my life that I can't get back. It's amazing what you don't get for $150 million.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
44,27-Nov-04,thunderzephyr,10," A Totally Different Viewing.
","Last night I saw the movie a second time, with my 20 year old son. The audience was of an entirely different demographic than the first viewing (which was an advance screening). The average age of the audience was about 35-45, with not too many teens in there. And guess what? Besides the fact that the entire theatre was PACKED, there was absolutely not a sound from the audience...like they were breathless. No snickering at blond hair, eyeliner, sultry looks from Bagoas, or any of the things that drew slight laughs when I saw it for the first time. It bolstered my hope that as time goes on and more people see it, there will be a more favorable opinion of it. ",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
45,27-Aug-23,MoalefSajad,7," Best of the greatest Generals of all time (Kidding)
","I met Oliver Stone while sitting at one of my regular coffee haunts in southern California, when he asked about what I was reading. I said it was my favorite biography on Alexander and that it was for the the 6th or 7th time, that it was the only one I know of written by a woman, and it was by far the best one. I told him I had read 5 including 2 from the ancient sources, and I do not read biographies. That Alexander had been my only exception. While we were talking, it seemed that he looked vaguely familiar, but I didn't know who he was until hearing months later that someone was making a movie about Alexander.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
46,17-Dec-07,beacitizen,1," How to pout in battle...
","I feel i must make people aware that there are many of us who have seen this film and don't care if Alexander liked boys or girls yet still think this motion picture is absolutely, terrifyingly, obtusely and almost intentionally awful in every way it could be. Some may love the issues it touches on but be warned, you may just find yourself spending far more time than you would ever wish trying to tell everyone you know just how absolutely terrible you thought it was. The actors, although mostly multi-million dollar ""heroes of Hollywood"" are made to look like children in a bad school play by a uniquely hollow script. Even the apparent ""historical accuracy"" which Oliver Stone so readily tells us of is poorly executed and occasionally misleading. The Persian army are not a collection of brain-dead simpletons running randomly around the field of battle like they're being told to go in two directions at once (i mean, really Oliver, wtf was that opening shot of them all about?) To further add to the humour value Colin Farrell's pre-battle chat to his ""generals"" (mostly a collection of model-turned-actor brainless pouters) is filled with a marvellous moment when Mr.Farrel lists off every single Greek name of every general in the room and a summary of what they're good at in battle. The scene is so leaden you wonder if Farrell found a copy of Stone's notes on who was supposed to be in the shot and just read them out. It was like bullet-point history with no character or life. Every second moment in this film heightens it's own tension to the Nth degree as if to cry out to the audience watching ""BUT LOOK, CAN YOU NOT SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?!?"" I hardly think Stone's assumption that his ""film"" (i think ""moooveee"" is more accurate) plays well with ""intelligent audiences"" is anywhere near the truth. I don't know, maybe his Mom likes it. If you like historical epics don't watch this.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

","The critic and film historian Robert Sarris said of Robert Rossen's 1956 epic 'Alexander the Great', featuring Richard Burton as our titular hero, that it ""aimed for greatness and lost honourably"". Oliver Stone's current offering to the Dionysian gods of cinematic excess, 'Alexander', has much in common with it's predecessor but, sadly, honour isn't one of them.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
48,6-Oct-05,samhorvat123,1," Worst movie I have ever seen!
","I think this movie was one of the worst I have seen. It was confusing, boring, and kind of frustrating. It was long and hard to watch. The battle scene near the beginning of the movie was alright though. During the movie, it kept flashing back to the past (example: 10 years ago, 6 years ago, 2 years ago) throughout the movie. Alexander kept changing, one minute he is a hero, the next minute he is a cruel angry man. When I learned about Alexander the great in school, he actually seemed great. I kept feeling like i wanted something to happen in the movie that I actually would enjoy. Like I said before, it was long and hard to watch. And why did Alexander's mother have a strange accent? It didn't make sense. I was very happy when the movie ended. Don't bother watching this movie, its a waste of almost 3 hours.",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv

","I may like Oliver Stone a great deal, but I am no fawning fanboy (-girl?) of his and am still able to spot poor quality in his films. This is not one of them. Alexander is a flawed masterpiece. It is an original fare, not really relying on any hackneyed formulas or stunning visual effects to get the message across or else mask poor writing. Everything is out in the open--bold, blunt and vivid. It moves back into storytelling mode, exploring the character of Alexander and what drives him to set out on the Persian Crusades. What is the force behind his insatiable conquering hunger?",/review/rw1452351/?ref_=tt_urv
